# The-Playboy-Chimp
Once upon a time, there lived a chimpanzee called Luchu Bandor (aka Playboy Chimp). Luchu was unhappily married to Bunty Mona, a short but cute little lady chimp. Luchu was tall and handsome — he was feeling uncomfortable taking Bunty to public places along with him. People would stare at them all the while. At one point, Luchu could not stand it anymore and he decided to do some justice to his name. He started looking for a new hope in the Lady Chimps’ High School. Every day Luchu would climb up a bamboo tree and wait for the morning drill to start. From there he could see each and every lady chimp doing their routine drill. Now, Luchu was looking for the tallest lady chimp that would be shorter than he; he would also like to consider someone a little taller than he. But someone of his same height will never be on his list. Every morning Luchu picks up a line of lady chimps and finds the best two according to his set criterion. His job has been made easy by the fact that the lady chimps in each line are ordered by their height, the shortest one is in the front and the tallest one is at the back. Your task is to help Luchu on one particular day to find two lady chimps: the tallest one shorter than he and the shortest one taller than he.
